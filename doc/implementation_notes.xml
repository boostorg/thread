			In the current Win32 implementation, creating a boost::thread object
			during dll initialization will result in deadlock because the thread 
			class constructor causes the current thread to wait on the thread that 
			is being created until it signals that it has finished its initialization, 
			and, as stated in the
			<ulink url="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/dllmain.asp">MSDN Library, "DllMain" article, "Remarks" section</ulink>,
			"Because DLL notifications are serialized, entry-point functions should not
			attempt to communicate with other threads or processes. Deadlocks may occur as a result."
			(Also see <ulink url="http://www.microsoft.com/msj/archive/S220.aspx">"Under the Hood", January 1996</ulink> 
			for a more detailed discussion of this issue).
