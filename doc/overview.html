<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Boost.Threads allows C++ programs to execute as multiple, asynchronous, independent,
  threads-of-execution. Each thread has its own machine state including program
  instruction counter and registers. Programs which execute as multiple threads
  are called multithreaded programs to distinguish them from traditional single-threaded
  programs. <a href="definitions.html">Definitions</a> gives a more complete description
  of the multithreading execution environment.</p>
<p>Multithreading provides several advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Programs which would otherwise block waiting for some external event can
    continue to respond if the blocking operation is placed in a separate thread.
    Multithreading is usually an absolute requirement for these programs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Well-designed multithreaded programs may execute faster than single-threaded
    programs, particularly on multiprocessor hardware. Note, however, that poorly-designed
    multithreaded programs are often slower that single-threaded programs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Some program designs may be easier to formulate using a multithreaded approach.
    After all, the real world is asynchronous!</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="dangers"></a>Dangers</h2>
<p>Beyond the errors which can occur in single-threaded programs, multithreaded
  programs are subject to additional errors:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="definitions.html#definition-race-condition">Race conditions</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="definitions.html#definition-deadlock">Deadlock</a> (sometimes called
    &quot;deadly embrace&quot;)</li>
  <li><a href="definitions.html#definition-priority-failure">Priority failures</a>
    (priority inversion, infinite overtaking, starvation, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Every multithreaded program must be designed carefully to avoid race conditions,
  priority failures and deadlock. These aren&#39;t rare or exotic failures - they
  are virtually guaranteed to occur unless multithreaded code is designed to avoid
  them. Priority failures are somewhat less common, but are nonetheless serious.</p>
<p>The <a href="introduction.html">Boost.Threads design</a> attempts to minimize
  these errors, but they will still occur unless the programmer proactively designs
  to avoid them.</p>
<h3><a name="testing-debugging"></a>Testing and debugging considerations</h3>
<p>Multithreaded programs are non-deterministic. In other words, the same program
  with the same input data may follow different execution paths each time it is
  invoked. That can make testing and debugging a nightmare:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Failures are often not repeatable.</li>
  <li>Probe effect causes debuggers to produce very different results from non-debug
    uses.</li>
  <li>Debuggers require special support to show thread state.</li>
  <li>Tests on a single processor system may give no indication of serious errors
    which would appear on multiprocessor systems, and visa versa. Thus test cases
    should include a varying number of processors.</li>
  <li>For programs which create a varying number of threads according to workload,
    tests which don&#39;t span the full range of possibilities may miss serious
    errors.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="head-start"></a>Getting a head start</h3>
<p>Although it might appear that multithreaded programs are inherently unreliable,
  many reliable multithreaded programs do exist. Multithreading techniques are
  known which lead to reliable programs.</p>
<p>Design patterns for reliable multithreaded programs, including the important
  <i>monitor</i> pattern, are presented in <cite> Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture
  Volume 2 - Patterns for Concurrent and Networked Objects</cite> [<a href=
        "bibliography.html#Schmidt-00">Schmidt 00</a>]. Many important multithreading
  programming considerations (independent of threading library) are discussed
  in <cite>Programming with POSIX Threads</cite> [<a href="bibliography.html#Butenhof-97">Butenhof
  97</a>].</p>
<p>Doing some reading before attempting multithreaded designs will give you a
  head start toward reliable multithreaded programs.</p>
<h2><a name="library"></a>C++ Standard Library usage in multithreaded programs</h2>
<h3><a name="runtime-libraries"></a>Runtime libraries</h3>
<p><b>Warning:</b> Multithreaded programs such as those using <b> Boost.Threads</b>
  must link to <a href="definitions.html#Thread-safe"> thread-safe</a> versions
  of all runtime libraries used by the program, including the runtime library
  for the C++ Standard Library. Otherwise
<a href="definitions.html#definition-race-condition">race
  conditions</a> will occur when multiple threads simultaneously execute runtime
  library functions for <i>new</i>, <i>delete</i>, or other language features
  which imply shared state.</p>
<h3><a name="non-thread-safe-functions"></a>Potentially non-thread-safe functions</h3>
<p>Certain C++ Standard Library functions inherited from C are particular problems
  because they hold internal state between calls:</p>
<ul>
  <li>rand</li>
  <li>strtok</li>
  <li>asctime</li>
  <li>ctime</li>
  <li>gmtime</li>
  <li>localtime</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to write thread-safe implementations of these by using <a href="tss.html#class-thread_specific_ptr">thread-specific
  storage</a>, and several C++ compiler vendors do just that. The technique is
  well-know and is explained in [<a href=
        "bibliography.html#Butenhof-97">Buttenhof 97</a>].</p>
<p>But at least one vendor (HP-UX) does not provide thread-safe implementations
  of the above functions in their otherwise thread-safe runtime library. Instead
  they provide replacement functions with different names and arguments.</p>
<p><b>Recommendation:</b> For the most portable, yet thread-safe code, use Boost
  replacements for the problem functions. See the <a href=
        "../../random/index.html">Boost Random Number Library</a> and <a href=
        "../../tokenizer/index.htm">Boost Tokenizer Library</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="common-gaurantees"></a>Common guarantees for all Boost.Threads components</h2>
<h3><a name="exceptions"></a>Exceptions</h3>
<p><b>Boost.Threads</b> destructors never throw exceptions. Unless otherwise specified,
  other <b>Boost.Threads</b> functions that do not have an exception-specification
  may throw implementation-defined exceptions.</p>
<p>In particular, <b>Boost.Threads</b> reports failure to allocate storage by
  throwing an exception of type std::bad_alloc, or a class derived from std::bad_alloc,
  failure to obtain thread resources other than memory by throwing an exception
  of type <a href="exceptions.html#class-thread_resource_error">boost::thread_resource_error</a>,
  and certain lock related failures by throwing an exception of type <a href="exceptions.html#class-lock_error">boost::lock_error</a></p>
<p><b>Rationale:</b> Follows the C++ Standard Library practice of allowing all
  functions except destructors or other specified functions to throw exceptions
  on errors.</p>
<h3><a name="non-copyable"></a>NonCopyable requirement</h3>
<p><b>Boost.Threads</b> classes documented as meeting the NonCopyable requirement
  disallow copy construction and copy assignment. For the sake of exposition,
  the synopsis of such classes show private derivation from <a href="../../utility/utility.htm">
  boost::noncopyable</a>. Users should not depend on this derivation, however,
  as implementations are free to meet the NonCopyable requirement in other ways.</p>
