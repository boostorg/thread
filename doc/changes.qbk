[section:changes Changes since boost 1.34]

Almost every line of code in __boost_thread__ has been changed since the 1.34 release of boost. However, most of the interface
changes have been extensions, so the new code is largely backwards-compatible with the old code. The new features and breaking
changes are described below.

[heading New Features]

* Instances of __thread__ and of the various lock types are now movable.

* Threads can be interrupted at __interruption_points__.

* Condition variables can now be used with any type that implements the __lockable_concept__, through the use of
`boost::condition_variable_any` (`boost::condition` is a `typedef` to `boost::condition_variable_any`, provided for backwards
compatibility). `boost::condition_variable` is provided as an optimization, and will only work with
`boost::unique_lock<boost::mutex>` (`boost::mutex::scoped_lock`).

* Thread IDs are separated from __thread__, so a thread can obtain it's own ID (using `boost::this_thread::get_id()`), and IDs can
be used as keys in associative containers, as they have the full set of comparison operators.

* Timeouts are now implemented using the Boost DateTime library, through a typedef `boost::system_time` for absolute timeouts, and
with support for relative timeouts in many cases. `boost::xtime` is supported for backwards compatibility only.

* Locks are implemented as publicly accessible templates `boost::lock_guard`, `boost::unique_lock`, `boost::shared_lock`, and
`boost::upgrade_lock`, which are templated on the type of the mutex. The __lockable_concept__ has been extended to include publicly
available __lock_ref__ and __unlock_ref__ member functions, which are used by the lock types.

[heading Breaking Changes]

The list below should cover all changes to the public interface which break backwards compatibility.

* __try_mutex__ has been removed, and the functionality subsumed into __mutex__. __try_mutex__ is left as a `typedef`,
but is no longer a separate class.

* __recursive_try_mutex__ has been removed, and the functionality subsumed into
__recursive_mutex__. __recursive_try_mutex__ is left as a `typedef`, but is no longer a separate class.

* `boost::detail::thread::lock_ops` has been removed. Code that relies on the `lock_ops` implementation detail will no longer work,
as this has been removed, as it is no longer necessary now that mutex types now have public __lock_ref__ and __unlock_ref__ member
functions.

* `scoped_lock` constructors with a second parameter of type `bool` are no longer provided. With previous boost releases,
``boost::mutex::scoped_lock some_lock(some_mutex,false);`` could be used to create a lock object that was associated with a mutex,
but did not lock it on construction. This facility has now been replaced with the constructor that takes a
`boost::defer_lock_type` as the second parameter: ``boost::mutex::scoped_lock some_lock(some_mutex,boost::defer_lock);``

* The broken `boost::read_write_mutex` has been replaced with __shared_mutex__.
