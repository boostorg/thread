      <purpose>
        <para>An object of class <classname>barrier</classname> is a synchronization 
        primitive used  to cause a set of threads to wait until they each perform a 
        certain function or each reach a particular point in their execution.</para>
      </purpose>

      <description>
		<para>When a barrier is created, it is initialized with a thread count N.
		The first N-1 calls to <code>wait()</code> will all cause their threads to be blocked. 
		The Nth call to <code>wait()</code> will allow all  of the waiting threads, including 
		the Nth thread, to be placed in a ready state.  The Nth call will also "reset"
		the barrier such that, if an additional N+1th call is made to <code>wait()</code>, 
		it will be as though this were the first call to <code>wait()</code>; in other
		words, the N+1th to 2N-1th calls to <code>wait()</code> will cause their
		threads to be blocked, and the 2Nth call to <code>wait()</code> will allow all of 
		the waiting threads, including the 2Nth thread, to be placed in a ready state
		and reset the barrier. This functionality allows the same set of N threads to re-use 
		a barrier object to  synchronize their execution at multiple points during their 
		execution.</para>
		<para>See <xref linkend="threads.glossary"/> for definitions of thread 
		states <link linkend="threads.glossary.thread-state">blocked</link>
		and <link linkend="threads.glossary.thread-state">ready</link>.
		Note that "waiting" is a synonym for blocked.</para>
