			<title>Documentation converted to BoostBook</title>

			<para>The documentation was converted to BoostBook format,
			and a number of errors and inconsistencies were
			fixed in the process.
			Since this was a fairly large task, there are likely to be 
			more errors and inconsistencies remaining. If you find any,
			please report them!</para>

		<section id="threads.release_notes.boost_1_32_0.change_log.static_link">
			<title>Static-link build option added</title>

			<para>The option to link &Boost.Threads; as a static
			library has been added back with some limitations.
			This feature was originally removed because
			<classname>boost::thread_specific_ptr</classname> required
			that &Boost.Threads; be dynamically linked in order for its
			cleanup functionality to work on Win32 platforms.
			Several options are currently being explored to resolve
			this issue. In the meantime, the ability to link 
			&Boost.Threads; statically has been added back in
			such a way that, on Win32 platforms only, the user is
			required to call the cleanup functions on_thread_exit() 
			and on_process_exit() at appropriate times. If these
			functions are not properly called cleanup will not
			work and leaks will result. In addition, in cases where
			&Boost.Threads; doesn't call the cleanup functions itself,
			the user is required to implement the (probably empty) function
			tss_cleanup_implemented() in order to eliminate linker errors.
			This function's only purpose is to serve as a flag: the linker
			error stating that the function is missing warns the
			the user of the necessity of calling the cleanup functions.
			In addition, if &Boost.Threads; later implements tss cleanup
			where it currently not implemented, the linker's
			duplicate symbol error should warn the user that their custom
			implementation is no longer needed.</para>
			
			<para>The decision to add back static-linking support
			was made because its lack is one of the most frequent complaints 
			about &Boost.Threads; and because the other approaches that are 
			being investigated to deal with 
			<classname>boost::thread_specific_ptr</classname>
			cleanup look fairly promising.
			
			<note>&Boost.Threads; is still dynamically linked by default.
			In order to force it to be statically linked, it is necessary to
			#define BOOST_THREAD_USE_LIB before any of the &Boost.Threads;
			header files are #included.</note>
			
			<note>If the <classname>boost::thread_specific_ptr</classname> cleanup
			issue cannot be resolved by some other means, it is quite
			possible that the option to statically link &Boost.Threads;
			will be removed again in a future version of Boost, at least
			for Win32 platforms. This is because the 
			<classname>boost::thread_specific_ptr</classname> functionality
			will be increasingly used by &Boost.Threads; itself,
			so that proper cleanup will become essential
			in future versions of &Boost.Threads;.</note>

			<title>Barrier functionality added</title>

			<para>A new class, <classname>boost::barrier</classname>, was added.</para>

		<section id="threads.release_notes.boost_1_32_0.change_log.read_write_mutex">
			<title>Read/write mutex functionality added</title>

			<para>New classes, 
			<classname>boost::read_write_mutex</classname>,
			<classname>boost::try_read_write_mutex</classname>, and
			<classname>boost::timed_read_write_mutex</classname>
			were added.
			
			<note>Since the read/write mutex and related classes are new,
			both interface and implementation are liable to change
			in future releases of &Boost.Threads;.
			The lock concepts and lock promotion in particular are
			still under discussion and very likely to change.</note>

		<section id="threads.release_notes.boost_1_32_0.change_log.thread_specific_ptr">
			<title>Thread-specific pointer functionality changed</title>

			<para>The <classname>boost::thread_specific_ptr</classname> 
			constructor now takes an optional pointer to a cleanup function that
			is called to release the thread-specific data that is being pointed
			to by <classname>boost::thread_specific_ptr</classname> objects.</para>

			<para>Fixed: the number of available thread-specific storage "slots"
			is too small on some platforms.</para>

			<para>Fixed: <functionname>thread_specific_ptr::reset()</functionname>
			doesn't check error returned by <functionname>tss::set()</functionname>
			(the <functionname>tss::set()</functionname> function now throws
			if it fails instead of returning an error code).</para>

			<para>Fixed: calling 
			<functionname>boost::thread_specific_ptr::reset()</functionname> or 
			<functionname>boost::thread_specific_ptr::release()</functionname>
			causes double-delete: once when 
			<functionname>boost::thread_specific_ptr::reset()</functionname> or
			<functionname>boost::thread_specific_ptr::release()</functionname> 
			is called and once when 
			<functionname>boost::thread_specific_ptr::~thread_specific_ptr()</functionname>
			is called.</para>

		<section id="threads.release_notes.boost_1_32_0.change_log.mutex">
			<title>Mutex implementation changed for Win32</title>

			<para>On Win32, <classname>boost::mutex</classname>, 
			<classname>boost::try_mutex</classname>, <classname>boost::recursive_mutex</classname>,
			and <classname>boost::recursive_try_mutex</classname> now use a Win32 critical section 
			whenever possible; otherwise they use a Win32 mutex. As before, 
			<classname>boost::timed_mutex</classname> and 
			<classname>boost::recursive_timed_mutex</classname> use a Win32 mutex.</para>
