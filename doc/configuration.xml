	as well as configuration macros meant to be supplied by the application. These
	macros are documented here.

	Indicates that threading support is available. This means both that there
	is a platform specific implementation for &Boost.Thread; and that
	threading support has been enabled in a platform specific manner. For instance,
	on the Win32 platform there&#39;s an implementation for &Boost.Thread;
	but unless the program is compiled against one of the multithreading runtimes
	(often determined by the compiler predefining the macro _MT) the BOOST_HAS_THREADS
	macro remains undefined.
