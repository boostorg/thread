<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>A mutex (short for mutual-exclusion) object is used to serializes access to
  a resource shared between multiple threads. The <a href="#Mutex">Mutex</a> concept,
  with <a href="#TryMutex">TryMutex</a> and <a href="#TimedMutex">TimedMutex</a>
  refinements, formalize the requirements. A model that implements Mutex and its
  refinements has two states: <b>locked</b> and <b>unlocked</b>. Before using
  a shared resource, a thread locks a <b>Boost.Threads</b> mutex object (an object
  whose type is a model of <a href="#Mutex-concept">Mutex</a> or one of it's
  refinements), insuring <a href="definitions.html#thread-safe">thread-safe</a>
  access to the shared resource. When use of the shared resource is complete,
  the thread unlocks the mutex object, allowing another thread to acquire the
  lock and use the shared resource.</p>
<p>Traditional C thread APIs, like POSIX threads or the Windows thread APIs, expose
  functions to lock and unlock a mutex object. This is dangerous since it&#39;s
  easy to forget to unlock a locked mutex. When the flow of control is complex,
  with multiple return points, the likelihood of forgetting to unlock a mutex
  object would become even greater. When exceptions are thrown, it becomes nearly
  impossible to ensure that the mutex object is unlocked properly when using these
  traditional API&#39;s. The result is <a href="definitions.html#deadlock">deadlock</a>.</p>
<p>Many C++ threading libraries use a pattern known as <i>Scoped Locking</i> <a href="bibliography.html#Schmidt-00">[Schmidt
  00]</a> to free the programmer from the need to explicitly lock and unlock mutex
  objects. With this pattern, a <a href="lock_concept.html">Lock</a> concept is
  employed where the lock object&#39;s constructor locks the associated mutex
  object and the destructor automatically does the unlocking. The <b>Boost.Threads</b>
  library takes this pattern to the extreme in that Lock concepts are the only
  way to lock and unlock a mutex object: lock and unlock functions are not exposed
  by any <b>Boost.Threads</b> mutex objects. This helps to ensure safe usage patterns,
  especially when code throws exceptions.</p>
<h2><a name="locking-strategies"></a>Locking Strategies</h2>
<p>Every mutex object follows one of several locking strategies. These strategies
  define the semantics for the locking operation when the calling thread already
  owns a lock on the mutex object.</p>
<h3><a name="locking-strategy-recursive"></a>Recursive</h3>
<p>With a recursive locking strategy when a thread attempts to acquire a lock
  on the mutex object for which it already owns a lock, the operation is successful.
  Note the distinction between a thread, which may have multiple locks outstanding
  on a recursive mutex object, and a lock object, which even for a recursive mutex
  object cannot have any of its lock functions called multiple times without first
  calling unlock.</p>
<p>Internally a lock count is maintained and the owning thread must unlock the
  mutex model the same number of times that it&#39;s locked it before the mutex
  object&#39;s state returns to unlocked. Since mutex objects in <b>Boost.Threads</b>
  expose locking functionality only through lock concepts, a thread will always
  unlock a mutex object the same number of times that it locked it. This helps
  to eliminate a whole set of errors typically found in traditional C style thread
  APIs.</p>
<p>Classes <a href="recursive_mutex.html#class-recursive_mutex">recursive_mutex</a>,
  <a href="recursive_mutex.html#class-recursive_try_mutex">recursive_try_mutex</a>
  and <a href="recursive_mutex.html#class-recursive_timed_mutex">recursive_timed_mutex</a>
  use this locking strategy.</p>
<h3><a name="locking-strategy-checked"></a>Checked</h3>
<p>With a checked locking strategy when a thread attempts to acquire a lock on
  the mutex object for which the thread already owns a lock, the operation will
  fail with some sort of error indication. Further, attempts by a thread to unlock
  a mutex object that was not locked by the thread will also return some sort
  of error indication. In <b>Boost.Threads</b>, an exception of type <a href="exceptions.html#class-lock_error">
  lock_error</a> would be thrown in these cases.</p>
<p><b>Boost.Threads</b> does not currently provide any mutex objects that use
  this strategy.</p>
<h3><a name="locking-strategy-unchecked"></a>Unchecked</h3>
<p>With an unchecked locking strategy when a thread attempts to acquire a lock
  on a mutex object for which the thread already owns a lock the operation will
  <a href="definitions.html#definition-deadlock">deadlock</a>. In general this
  locking strategy is less safe than a checked or recursive strategy, but it&#39;s
  also a faster strategy and so is employed by many libraries.</p>
<p><b>Boost.Threads</b> does not currently provide any mutex objects that use
  this strategy.</p>
<h3><a name="locking-strategy-unspecified"></a>Unspecified</h3>
<p>With an unspecified locking strategy, when a thread attempts to acquire a lock
  on a mutex object for which the thread already owns a lock the operation results
  in <b>undefined behavior</b>.</p>
<p>In general a mutex object with an unspecified locking strategy is unsafe, and
  it requires programmer discipline to use the mutex object properly. However,
  this strategy allows an implementation to be as fast as possible with no restrictions
  on its implementation. This is especially true for portable implementations
  that wrap the native threading support of a platform. For this reason, the classes
  <a href="mutex.html#class-mutex">mutex</a>, <a href="mutex.html#class-try_mutex">try_mutex</a>
  and <a href="mutex.html#class-timed_mutex">timed_mutex</a> use this locking
  strategy despite the lack of safety.</p>
<h2><a name="scheduling-policies"></a>Scheduling Policies</h2>
<p>Every mutex object follows one of several scheduling policies. These policies
  define the semantics when the mutex object is unlocked and there is more than
  one thread waiting to acquire a lock. In other words, the policy defines which
  waiting thread shall acquire the lock.</p>
<h3><a name="scheduling-policy-FIFO"></a>FIFO</h3>
<p>With a FIFO scheduling policy, threads waiting for the lock will acquire it
  in a first come first serve order (or First In First Out). This can help prevent
  a high priority thread from starving lower priority threads that are also waiting
  on the mutex object's lock.</p>
<h3><a name="scheduling-policy-priority-driven"></a>Priority Driven</h3>
<p>With a Priority Driven scheduling policy, the thread with the highest priority
  acquires the lock. Note that this means that low-priority threads may never
  acquire the lock if the mutex object has high contention and there is always
  at least one high-priority thread waiting. This is known as thread starvation.
  When multiple threads of the same priority are waiting on the mutex object's
  lock one of the other scheduling priorities will determine which thread shall
  acquire the lock.</p>
<h3><a name="scheduling-policy-unspecified"></a>Unspecified</h3>
<p>The mutex object does not specify a scheduling policy. In order to ensure portability,
  all <b>Boost.Threads</b> mutex models use an unspecified scheduling policy.</p>
<h2><a name="concept-requirements"></a>Concept Requirements</h2>
<h3><a name="Mutex-concept"></a>Mutex Concept</h3>
<p>A Mutex object has two states: locked and unlocked. Mutex object state can
  only be determined by an object meeting the <a href="lock_concept.html#ScopedLock">ScopedLock</a>
  requirements and constructed for the Mutex object.</p>
<p>A Mutex is <a href="../../utility/utility.htm#Class_noncopyable">NonCopyable</a>.</p>
