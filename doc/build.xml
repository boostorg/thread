	How you build the &Boost.Threads; libraries, and how you build your own applications
	that use those libraries, are some of the most frequently asked questions. Build
	processes are difficult to deal with in a portable manner. That's one reason
	why &Boost.Threads; makes use of &Boost.Build;.
	In general you should refer to the documentation for &Boost.Build;.
	This document will only supply you with some simple usage examples for how to
	use <emphasis>bjam</emphasis> to build and test &Boost.Threads;. In addition, this document
	will try to explain the build requirements so that users may create their own
	build processes (for instance, create an IDE specific project), both for building
	and testing &Boost.Threads;, as well as for building their own projects using
	&Boost.Threads;.

	To build the &Boost.Threads; libraries using &Boost.Build;, simply change to the
	directory <emphasis>boost_root</emphasis>/libs/thread/build and execute the command:
		<programlisting>bjam -sTOOLS=<emphasis>toolset</emphasis></programlisting>
	This will create the debug and the release builds of the &Boost.Threads; library.
	<note>Invoking the above command in <emphasis>boost_root</emphasis> will build all of 
	the Boost distribution, including &Boost.Threads;.</note>

	The Jamfile supplied with &Boost.Threads; produces a dynamic link library named
	<emphasis>boost_thread{build-specific-tags}.{extension}</emphasis>, where the build-specific
	tags indicate the toolset used to build the library, whether it's a debug or release
	build, what version of Boost was used, etc.; and the extension is the appropriate extension
	for a dynamic link library for the platform for which &Boost.Threads; is being built.
	For instance, a debug library built for Win32 with VC++ 7.1 using Boost 1.31 would
	be named <emphasis>boost_thread-vc71-mt-gd-1_31.dll</emphasis>.

	The source files that are used to create the &Boost.Threads; library
	are all of the *.cpp files found in <emphasis>boost_root</emphasis>/libs/thread/src.
	These need to be built with the compiler's and linker's multi-threading support enabled.
	If you want to create your own build solution you'll have to follow these same
	guidelines. One of the most frequently reported problems when trying to do this
	occurs from not enabling the compiler's and linker's support for multi-threading.
