	<para>
	How you build the &Boost.Thread; libraries, and how you build your own applications
	that use those libraries, are some of the most frequently asked questions. Build
	processes are difficult to deal with in a portable manner. That's one reason
	why &Boost.Thread; makes use of &Boost.Build;.
	In general you should refer to the documentation for &Boost.Build;.
	This document will only supply you with some simple usage examples for how to
	use <emphasis>bjam</emphasis> to build and test &Boost.Thread;. In addition, this document
	will try to explain the build requirements so that users may create their own
	build processes (for instance, create an IDE specific project), both for building
	and testing &Boost.Thread;, as well as for building their own projects using
	&Boost.Thread;.

		<title>Building the &Boost.Thread; Libraries</title>
        <para>
            Building the &Boost.Thread; Library depends on how you intend to use it. You have several options:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    Using as a <link linkend="thread.build.precompiled">precompiled</link> library, possibly
                    with auto-linking, or for use from within an IDE.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    Use from a <link linkend="thread.build.bjam">&Boost.Build;</link> project.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    Using in <link linkend="thread.build.source">source</link> form.
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <section id="thread.build.precompiled">
            <title>Precompiled</title>
            <para>
                Using the &Boost.Thread; library in precompiled form is the way to go if you want to
                install the library to a standard place, from where your linker is able to resolve code
                in binary form. You also will want this option if compile time is a concern. Multiple 
                variants are available, for different toolsets and build variants (debug/release).
                The library files are named <emphasis>{lead}boost_thread{build-specific-tags}.{extension}</emphasis>,
                where the build-specific-tags indicate the toolset used to build the library, whether it's
                a debug or release build, what version of &Boost; was used, etc.; and the lead and extension
                are the appropriate extensions for a dynamic link library or static library for the platform
                for which &Boost.Thread; is being built.
            	For instance, a debug build of the dynamic library built for Win32 with VC++ 7.1 using Boost 1.34 would
            	be named <emphasis>boost_thread-vc71-mt-gd-1_34.dll</emphasis>.
                More information on this should be available from the &Boost.Build; documentation.
            </para>
            <para>
                Building should be possible with the default configuration. If you are running into problems,
                it might be wise to adjust your local settings of &Boost.Build; though. Typically you will
                need to get your user-config.jam file to reflect your environment, i.e. used toolsets. Please
                refer to the &Boost.Build; documentation to learn how to do this.
            </para>
            <para>
                To create the libraries you need to open a command shell and change to the 
                <emphasis>boost_root</emphasis> directory. From there you give the command 
                <programlisting>bjam --toolset=<emphasis>mytoolset</emphasis> stage --with-thread</programlisting>
                Replace <emphasis>mytoolset</emphasis> with the name of your toolset, e.g. msvc-7.1 .
                This will compile and put the libraries into the <emphasis>stage</emphasis> directory which is just below the
                <emphasis>boost_root</emphasis> directory. &Boost.Build; by default will generate static and 
                dynamic variants for debug and release.
            </para>
            <note>
                Invoking the above command without the --with-thread switch &Boost.Build; will build all of 
	            the Boost distribution, including &Boost.Thread;.
            </note>
            <para>
                The next step is to copy your libraries to a place where your linker is able to pick them up.
                It is also quite possible to leave them in the stage directory and instruct your IDE to take them
                from there.
            </para>
            <para>
                In your IDE you then need to add <emphasis>boost_root</emphasis>/boost to the paths where the compiler
                expects to find files to be included. For toolsets that support <emphasis>auto-linking</emphasis>
                it is not necessary to explicitly specify the name of the library to link against, it is sufficient
                to specify the path of the stage directory. Typically this is true on Windows. For gcc you need 
                to specify the exact library name (including all the tags). Please don't forget that threading
                support must be turned on to be able to use the library. You should be able now to build your
                project from the IDE.

            <title>&Boost.Build; Project</title>
            <para>
                If you have decided to use &Boost.Build; as a build environment for your application, you simply
                need to add a single line to your <emphasis>Jamroot</emphasis> file:
                <programlisting>use-project /boost : {path-to-boost-root} ;</programlisting>
                where <emphasis>{path-to-boost-root}</emphasis> needs to be replaced with the location of
                your copy of the boost tree.
                Later when you specify a component that needs to link against &Boost.Thread; you specify this
                as e.g.:
                <programlisting>exe myapp : {myappsources} /boost//thread ;</programlisting>
                and you are done.

            <title>Source Form</title>
            <para>
                Of course it is also possible to use the &Boost.Thread; library in source form.
                First you need to specify the <emphasis>boost_root</emphasis>/boost directory as
                a path where your compiler expects to find files to include. It is not easy
                to isolate the &Boost.Thread; include files from the rest of the boost 
                library though. You would also need to isolate every include file that the thread
                library depends on. Next you need to copy the files from 
                <emphasis>boost_root</emphasis>/libs/thread/src to your project and instruct your
                build system to compile them together with your project. Please look into the
                <emphasis>Jamfile</emphasis> in <emphasis>boost_root</emphasis>/libs/thread/build
                to find out which compiler options and defines you will need to get a clean compile.
                Using the boost library in this way is the least recommended, and should only be
                considered if avoiding dependency on &Boost.Build; is a requirement. Even if so
                it might be a better option to use the library in it's precompiled form. 
                Precompiled downloads are available from the boost consulting web site, or as
                part of most linux distributions.
