	<para>&Boost.Threads; currently supports two types of mutex concepts:
	ordinary <link linkend="threads.concepts.mutexes">Mutexes</link>,
	which allow only one thread at a time to access a resource, and
	<link linkend="threads.concepts.read-write-mutexes">Read/Write Mutexes</link>,
	which allow only one thread at a time to access a resource when it is
	being modified (the "Write" part of Read/Write), but allows multiple threads
	to access a resource when it is only being referenced (the "Read" part of
	Read/Write).</para>

		<title>Mutexes</title>

		<note>Certain changes to the mutexes and lock concepts are
		currently under discussion. In particular, the combination of
		the multiple lock concepts into a single lock concept
		is likely, and the combination of the multiple mutex
		concepts into a single mutex concept is also possible.</note>
		
		<para>A mutex (short for mutual-exclusion) object is used to serialize
		access to a resource shared between multiple threads. The
		<link linkend="threads.concepts.Mutex">Mutex</link> concept, with
		<link linkend="threads.concepts.TryMutex">TryMutex</link> and
		<link linkend="threads.concepts.TimedMutex">TimedMutex</link> refinements,
		formalize the requirements. A model that implements Mutex and its
		refinements has two states: <emphasis role="bold">locked</emphasis> and
		<emphasis role="bold">unlocked</emphasis>. Before using a shared resource, a
		thread locks a &Boost.Threads; mutex object
		(an object whose type is a model of
		<link linkend="threads.concepts.Mutex">Mutex</link> or one of it's
		refinements), ensuring
		<link linkend="threads.glossary.thread-safe">thread-safe</link> access to
		the shared resource. When use of the shared resource is complete, the thread
		unlocks the mutex object, allowing another thread to acquire the lock and
		use the shared resource.</para>
		<para>Traditional C thread APIs, like POSIX threads or the Windows thread
		APIs, expose functions to lock and unlock a mutex object. This is dangerous
		since it's easy to forget to unlock a locked mutex. When the flow of control
		is complex, with multiple return points, the likelihood of forgetting to
		unlock a mutex object becomes even greater. When exceptions are thrown,
		it becomes nearly impossible to ensure that the mutex object is unlocked
		properly when using these traditional API's. The result is
		<link linkend="threads.glossary.deadlock">deadlock</link>.</para>
		<para>Many C++ threading libraries use a pattern known as <emphasis>Scoped
		Locking</emphasis> &cite.SchmidtStalRohnertBuschmann; to free the programmer from
		the need to explicitly lock and unlock mutex objects. With this pattern, a
		<link linkend="threads.concepts.lock-concepts">Lock</link> concept is employed where
		the lock object's constructor locks the associated mutex object and the
		destructor automatically does the unlocking. The
		&Boost.Threads; library takes this pattern to
		the extreme in that Lock concepts are the only way to lock and unlock a
		mutex object: lock and unlock functions are not exposed by any
		&Boost.Threads; mutex objects. This helps to
		ensure safe usage patterns, especially when code throws exceptions.</para>

		<section id="threads.concepts.locking-strategies">
			<title>Locking Strategies</title>
			
			<para>Every mutex object follows one of several locking strategies. These
			strategies define the semantics for the locking operation when the calling
			thread already owns a lock on the mutex object.</para>
			
			<section id="threads.concepts.recursive-locking-strategy">
				<title>Recursive Locking Strategy</title>
			
				<para>With a recursive locking strategy, when a thread attempts to acquire
				a lock on the mutex object for which it already owns a lock, the operation
				is successful. Note the distinction between a thread, which may have
				multiple locks outstanding on a recursive mutex object, and a lock object,
				which even for a recursive mutex object cannot have any of its lock
				functions called multiple times without first calling unlock.</para>
				
				<para>Internally a lock count is maintained and the owning thread must
				unlock the mutex object the same number of times that it locked it before
				the mutex object's state returns to unlocked. Since mutex objects in
				&Boost.Threads; expose locking
				functionality only through lock concepts, a thread will always unlock a
				mutex object the same number of times that it locked it. This helps to
				eliminate a whole set of errors typically found in traditional C style
				thread APIs.</para>
				
				<para>Classes <classname>boost::recursive_mutex</classname>,
				<classname>boost::recursive_try_mutex</classname> and
				<classname>boost::recursive_timed_mutex</classname> use this locking
				strategy.</para>
			</section>
			
			<section id="threads.concepts.checked-locking-strategy">
				<title>Checked Locking Strategy</title>
				
				<para>With a checked locking strategy, when a thread attempts to acquire a
				lock on the mutex object for which the thread already owns a lock, the
				operation will fail with some sort of error indication. Further, attempts
				by a thread to unlock a mutex object that was not locked by the thread
				will also return some sort of error indication. In
				&Boost.Threads;, an exception of type
				<classname>boost::lock_error</classname> 
				would be thrown in these cases.</para>
				
				<para>&Boost.Threads; does not currently
				provide any mutex objects that use this strategy.</para>

				<title>Unchecked Locking Strategy</title>
				
				<para>With an unchecked locking strategy, when a thread attempts to acquire
				a lock on a mutex object for which the thread already owns a lock the
				operation will
				<link linkend="threads.glossary.deadlock">deadlock</link>. In general
				this locking strategy is less safe than a checked or recursive strategy,
				but it's also a faster strategy and so is employed by many libraries.</para>
				
				<para>&Boost.Threads; does not currently
				provide any mutex objects that use this strategy.</para>
			</section>
			
			<section id="threads.concepts.unspecified-locking-strategy">
				<title>Unspecified Locking Strategy</title>
				
				<para>With an unspecified locking strategy, when a thread attempts to
				acquire a lock on a mutex object for which the thread already owns a lock
				the operation results in 
				<link linkend="threads.glossary.undefined-behavior">undefined behavior</link>.
				</para>
				
				<para>In general a mutex object with an unspecified locking strategy is
				unsafe, and it requires programmer discipline to use the mutex object
				properly. However, this strategy allows an implementation to be as fast as
				possible with no restrictions on its implementation. This is especially
				true for portable implementations that wrap the native threading support
				of a platform. For this reason, the classes
				<classname>boost::mutex</classname>,
				<classname>boost::try_mutex</classname> and
				<classname>boost::timed_mutex</classname> use this locking strategy
				despite the lack of safety.</para>

		<section id="threads.concepts.sheduling-policies">
			<title>Scheduling Policies</title>
			
			<para>Every mutex object follows one of several scheduling policies. These
			policies define the semantics when the mutex object is unlocked and there is
			more than one thread waiting to acquire a lock. In other words, the policy
			defines which waiting thread shall acquire the lock.</para>
			
			<section id="threads.concepts.FIFO-scheduling-policy">
				<title>FIFO Scheduling Policy</title>
				
				<para>With a FIFO ("First In First Out") scheduling policy, threads waiting 
				for the lock will acquire it in a first-come-first-served order.
				This can help prevent a high priority thread from starving lower priority
				threads that are also waiting on the mutex object's lock.</para>
			</section>
			
			<section id="threads.concepts.priority-driven-scheduling-policy">
				<title>Priority Driven Policy</title>
				
				<para>With a Priority Driven scheduling policy, the thread with the
				highest priority acquires the lock. Note that this means that low-priority
				threads may never acquire the lock if the mutex object has high contention
				and there is always at least one high-priority thread waiting. This is
				known as thread starvation. When multiple threads of the same priority are
				waiting on the mutex object's lock one of the other scheduling priorities
				will determine which thread shall acquire the lock.</para>

		<para>A read/write mutex (short for reader/writer mutual-exclusion) object
		is used to serialize access to a resource shared between multiple 
		threads, where multiple "readers" can share simultaneous access, but 
		"writers" require exclusive access. The
		<link linkend="threads.concepts.ReadWriteMutex">ReadWriteMutex</link> concept, with 
		<link linkend="threads.concepts.TryReadWriteMutex">TryReadWriteMutex</link> and 
		<link linkend="threads.concepts.TimedReadWriteMutex"> TimedReadWriteMutex</link>
		refinements formalize the requirements. A model that implements 
		ReadWriteMutex and its refinements has three states: 
		<emphasis role="bold">read-locked</emphasis>,
		<emphasis role="bold">write-locked</emphasis>, and 
		<emphasis role="bold">unlocked</emphasis>.
		Before reading from a shared resource, a thread 
		<emphasis role="bold">read-locks</emphasis> 
		a &Boost.Threads; read/write mutex object
		(an object whose type is a model of
		<link linkend="threads.concepts.ReadWriteMutex">ReadWriteMutex</link>
		or one of it's refinements), ensuring 
		<link linkend="threads.glossary.thread-safe">thread-safe</link>
		access for reading from the shared resource. Before writing 
		to a shared resource, a thread 
		<emphasis role="bold">write-locks</emphasis> a &Boost.Threads; 
		read/write mutex object
		(an object whose type is a model of
		<link linkend="threads.concepts.ReadWriteMutex">ReadWriteMutex</link>
		or one of it's refinements), ensuring 
		<link linkend="threads.glossary.thread-safe">thread-safe</link>
		access for altering the shared resource. When use of the shared 
		resource is complete, the thread unlocks the mutex object, 
		allowing another thread to acquire the lock and use the shared 
		resource.</para>
		
		<para>Traditional C thread APIs that provide read/write mutex
		primitives (like POSIX threads) expose functions to lock and unlock a
		mutex object. This is dangerous since it's easy to forget to unlock a
		locked mutex. When the flow of control is complex, with multiple
		return points, the likelihood of forgetting to unlock a mutex object
		becomes even greater. When exceptions are thrown, it becomes nearly
		impossible to ensure that the mutex object is unlocked
		properly when using these traditional API's. The result is
		<link linkend="threads.glossary.deadlock">deadlock</link>.</para>
		
		<para>Many C++ threading libraries use a pattern known as <emphasis>Scoped
		Locking</emphasis> &cite.SchmidtStalRohnertBuschmann; to free the
		programmer from the need to explicitly lock and unlock
		read/write mutex objects. With this  pattern, a 
		<link linkend="threads.concepts.read-write-lock-concepts">Read/Write Lock</link>
		concept is employed where the lock object's constructor locks
		the associated read/write mutex object
		and the destructor automatically does the unlocking. The
		&Boost.Threads; library takes this pattern to
		the extreme in that 
		<link linkend="threads.concepts.read-write-lock-concepts">Read/Write Lock</link>
		concepts are the only way to lock and unlock a read/write mutex
		object: lock and unlock functions are not exposed by any
		&Boost.Threads; read/write mutex objects. This helps to
		ensure safe usage patterns, especially when code throws exceptions.</para>

			<para>A read/write lock object provides a safe means for locking
			and unlocking a read/write mutex object (an object whose type is
			a model of 
			<link linkend="threads.concepts.ReadWriteMutex">ReadWriteMutex</link> 
			or one of its refinements). In other words they are an
			implementation of the <emphasis>Scoped Locking</emphasis>
			&cite.SchmidtStalRohnertBuschmann; pattern. The

			<link linkend="threads.concepts.ScopedTryReadWriteLock">ScopedTryReadWriteLock</link>, and 
			<link linkend="threads.concepts.ScopedTimedReadWriteLock">ScopedTimedReadWriteLock</link>
			concepts formalize the requirements.</para>
			
			<para>Read/write lock objects are constructed with a reference to a
			read/write mutex object and typically acquire ownership of the 
			read/write mutex object by setting its state to locked. They also
			ensure ownership is relinquished in the destructor. Lock objects
			also expose functions to query the lock status and to manually lock
			and unlock the read/write mutex object.</para>
			
			<para>Read/write lock objects are meant to be short lived, expected
			to be used at block scope only. The read/write lock objects are not 
			<link linkend="threads.glossary.thread-safe">thread-safe</link>.
			Read/write lock objects must maintain state to indicate whether or
			not they've been locked and this state is not protected by any
			synchronization concepts. For this reason a read/write lock object
			should never be shared between multiple threads.</para>
