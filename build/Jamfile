# Boost.Threads build Jamfile
#
# Declares the following targets:
#   1. libboost_thread, a static link library.
#      1a. On Win32 (when PTW32 is not defined), a dynamic link library
#          boost_threadmon, which must be used in conjunction with
#          libboost_thread. Note that this DLL *must* be used through static
#          linking to the import library.  Dynamic loading will cause undefined
#          behavior.
# Additional configuration variables used:
#   1. PTW32 may be used on Win32 platforms to specify that the pthreads-win32
#      library should be used instead of "native" threads. This feature is
#      mostly used for testing and it's generally recommended you use the
#      native threading libraries instead. PTW32 should be set to be a list
#      of two strings, the first specifying the installation path of the
#      pthreads-win32 library and the second specifying which library
#      variant to link against (see the pthreads-win32 documentation).
#      Example: jam -sPTW32="c:\pthreads-win32 pthreadVCE.lib"

# Declare the location of this subproject relative to the root.
subproject libs/thread/build ;

# Include threads.jam for Boost.Threads global build information.
# This greatly simplifies the Jam code needed to configure the build
# for the various Win32 build types.
